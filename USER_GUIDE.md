# UDCF v4.0 PRO: User Guide & Manual

## 1. System Setup
Before running a simulation, configure your environment using the left sidebar:
- **Systemic Factors:** Adjust the **Recovery Factor (\(k_Y\))** to account for energy losses in your specific system.
- **Kinematics:** Input the **Mass** of the tool and the impact **Velocity**.

## 2. Tool Geometry
Define the physical characteristics of your cutting edge:
- **Radius (\(r_e\)) & Contact (\(L_e\)):** These define the microscopic surface area of the cut.
- **Wedge Angle (\(\theta_w\)):** A critical factor in the Impedance equation.
- **Manual Overrides:** Use these if you have pre-calculated **Impedance (\(\Phi\))** or **Area (\(A\))** values from external sensors.

## 3. Running the Simulation
1. Click **RUN SIMULATION** in the top right.
2. Observe the **Live Physics Render Engine**.
3. **Green Glow / Split Wood:** Indicates \(\eta \ge 1\) (Successful Severance).
4. **Red Glow / Tool Bounce:** Indicates \(\eta < 1\) (Insufficient Energy).

## 4. Interpreting Results
- **Separation Index (\(\eta\)):** The most important value. If it is above 1.0, the cut is physically possible.
- **SI Vector Analysis:** Look at the bars in the center. If the **Geometric** bar is low, your tool is too blunt or the friction is too high. If the **Kinematic** bar is low, you need more speed or mass.
- **Energy Graph:** The blue curve shows your energy potential. The red dotted line is your "Wall"—you must cross it to succeed.

## 5. Data Management
At the end of your experiment, click **EXPORT RESEARCH DATA**. This generates a CSV file including all input parameters and final calculations for your research paper or lab report.
